# tailnet Threat Model

## Overview

tailnet is a Go-based proxy manager built on Tailscale's tsnet library, designed to expose multiple services on a Tailnet through a single configuration file. This document outlines the security considerations, intended use cases, and known limitations.

## Intended Use Case

**tailnet is designed for relatively trusted environments such as:**

- Home labs
- Personal development environments
- Small team internal networks
- Testing and staging environments

**tailnet is NOT designed for:**

- Security-critical production environments
- Public-facing internet services
- High-security enterprise deployments
- Environments requiring strict compliance (PCI-DSS, HIPAA, etc.)

## Trust Boundaries

### Trusted Components

1. **Tailscale Network**: The Tailnet is considered trusted; all nodes authenticated via Tailscale are trusted
2. **Configuration Source**: The TOML configuration file or Docker labels are trusted inputs
3. **Backend Services**: All configured backend services are trusted
4. **Host System**: The system running tailnet is fully trusted

### Untrusted Components

1. **External Networks**: Any network outside the Tailnet
2. **Unauthenticated Requests**: Requests not authenticated by Tailscale

## Security Model

### Authentication & Authorization

- **Primary Security**: Relies entirely on Tailscale's authentication and network security
- **No Additional Auth**: tailnet does not implement its own authentication layer
- **Network-Level Security**: Security is enforced at the network level via Tailscale ACLs

### Data Protection

- **Encryption in Transit**: Provided by Tailscale's WireGuard implementation
- **No Data at Rest**: tailnet does not store persistent data
- **Secret Management**:
  - OAuth credentials can be provided via files or environment variables
  - Secrets are redacted in logs but held in memory unencrypted

## Known Security Considerations

### 1. Proxy Trust Model

- tailnet acts as a reverse proxy with full access to request/response data
- No request filtering or sanitization is performed
- All headers (except `Host`) are forwarded as-is
- Response bodies are streamed without inspection

### 2. Service Exposure

- Any service configured in tailnet is accessible to all Tailnet members (subject to Tailscale ACLs)
- No per-service authentication is implemented
- Funnel mode exposes services to the public internet (use with extreme caution)

### 3. Configuration Security

- Configuration files may contain sensitive data (OAuth tokens)
- File permissions should be restricted (recommended: 600)
- Docker labels are visible to anyone with Docker API access

### 4. Resource Limits

- No built-in rate limiting
- No request size limits
- No connection limits
- Vulnerable to resource exhaustion from trusted Tailnet members

### 5. Logging & Monitoring

- Access logs may contain sensitive information
- Whois data includes user identities
- Metrics endpoint has no authentication (binds to localhost by default)

## Threat Scenarios

### Out of Scope Threats

1. **Malicious Backend Services**: Compromised backend services
2. **Host System Compromise**: Root access to tailnet host
3. **Tailscale Infrastructure Compromise**: Issues with Tailscale's security
4. **Side-Channel Attacks**: Timing attacks, cache attacks, etc.
5. **Supply Chain Attacks**: Compromised dependencies

## Security Best Practices

### Deployment

1. Run tailnet with minimal privileges
2. Use a dedicated service account
3. Restrict configuration file permissions
4. Enable access logging for audit trails
5. Monitor resource usage

### Configuration

1. Use file-based secrets or environment variables instead of inline configuration
2. Limit funnel usage to truly public services only
3. Configure appropriate timeouts for all connections
4. Use TLS for backend connections where possible

### Network

1. Configure Tailscale ACLs appropriately
2. Monitor Tailnet access patterns

### Monitoring

1. Enable Prometheus metrics (localhost only)
2. Monitor for unusual access patterns
3. Set up alerts for error rates
4. Track backend health status

## Security Updates

- tailnet follows Go's security update cycle
- Dependencies are regularly updated
- Security issues should be reported via GitHub issues (public project)
- No formal security advisory process exists

## Disclaimer

tailnet is provided as-is for use in trusted environments. Users deploying tailnet accept responsibility for:

- Evaluating its suitability for their use case
- Implementing additional security controls as needed
- Monitoring and responding to security events
- Keeping the software and its dependencies updated
